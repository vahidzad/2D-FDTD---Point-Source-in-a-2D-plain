# 2D-FDTD---Point-Source-in-a-2D-plain

The codes are the Python implementation of a point source in a 2-D plain
The boundry conditions are different in the two cases, the perfectly matched layer (PML) absorbs and dissipates the incident electromagnetic wave while the
perfect electric conductor boundry condition (PEC) reflects it
The codes are based on the EE 5303 course by Raymond C. Rumpf
